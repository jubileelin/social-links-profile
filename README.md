### What I learned

I tried to apply some knowledge that I learned from the last challenge about using different CSS units in order to create responsive designs and apply it to this design. 

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with using different CSS units, and maybe eventually learn CSS animations so I can make this profile more intriguing. I also want to try to implement mobile-first workflow into my design in accordance with what many companies are doing today.
